# KAI Streaming Fixes

## Problems Fixed

1. **Streaming Implementation Issues**:
   - Fixed error handling in the streaming utility to prevent double-closing streams
   - Removed controller.error() call to allow error messages to be delivered through the stream
   - Improved JSON encoding to properly escape all special characters

2. **API Route Issues**:
   - Cleaned up excessive debug logging that could potentially expose sensitive API key information
   - Added better error handling for malformed input data
   - Reduced the verbosity of logs to improve performance
   - Fixed headers for streaming responses

3. **Client-Side Implementation Issues**:
   - Removed the redundant fetch fallback that was creating duplicate requests
   - Simplified error handling and state updates to prevent race conditions
   - Reduced the initial buffer threshold from 5 to 3 characters for faster initial display
   - Removed excessive debugging logs that were slowing down the UI

4. **Testing**:
   - Added a test endpoint `/api/test-kai` that can be used to verify the streaming implementation
   - Added a "Test Streaming" button to the debug panel to test the streaming without hitting the OpenAI API

## Files Modified

1. `lib/streaming.ts`: Fixed stream controller error handling
2. `app/api/kai-chat/route.ts`: Cleaned up and improved API route
3. `components/kai-assistant.tsx`: Simplified client implementation and removed redundant code
4. `app/api/test-kai/route.ts`: Added a test endpoint for verifying streaming
5. `kai-streaming-fix.sh`: Created a deployment script

## How to Test

1. Deploy the changes using `./kai-streaming-fix.sh`
2. Visit the KAI demo page at `/demos/kai`
3. Click the "Show Debug" button to reveal the debug panel
4. Click "Test Streaming" to test with the test endpoint
5. Try sending a normal message to test with the real OpenAI integration

## Benefits

1. **More Reliable**: The streaming implementation is now more robust and less prone to hanging connections
2. **Faster Initial Response**: Reduced buffer size means text appears on screen sooner
3. **Better Error Handling**: Errors are now properly propagated to the client
4. **No Duplicate Requests**: Removed the redundant fetch fallback that was creating duplicate requests
5. **Improved Security**: Removed sensitive information from logs
