# Kai Assistant Streaming Fixes

## Problems Identified
1. The Kai Assistant component was not properly handling streaming responses
2. The API route format didn't match what the client component expected
3. The response format from the OpenAI API wasn't being properly formatted
4. Debug logs were verbose and slowing down the UI
5. The initial buffer was too large, delaying the first display of text

## Solutions Implemented

### API Route Updates (`app/api/kai-chat/route.ts`)
- Updated to handle both URL query parameters (for EventSource) and direct POST requests
- Added the system prompt back to properly format responses
- Simplified the response streaming format to be more consistent
- Used a modern OpenAI model (gpt-4o) for better responses
- Added proper error handling with typed errors

### Streaming Utility (`lib/streaming.ts`)
- Created a reusable streaming utility to handle ReadableStream creation
- Added error handling for stream processing
- Made the streaming implementation more robust and maintainable

### Client Component Updates (`components/kai-assistant.tsx`)
- Improved the `extractDeltaText` function to better handle various response formats
- Reduced the initial buffer size from 20 to 5 characters for faster initial display
- Enhanced the rate limiting and buffering logic to be more efficient
- Added better error handling and recovery for connection issues
- Improved the UI update mechanism to be more responsive
- Removed excessive debug logging that was slowing the UI
- Added timeout handling to prevent hanging connections

## Testing
The site is now accessible at https://demos.noyesai.com/demos/kai, and the API changes should provide a more reliable streaming experience for users.

## Deployment
All changes have been deployed to the production server and committed to the GitHub repository under the `new-main` branch.
