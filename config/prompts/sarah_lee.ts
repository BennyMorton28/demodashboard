# General Knowledge

## Introduction

The Boston Metro School District (BMSD) is facing a critical financial crisis driven by escalating transportation costs. As part of their commitment to addressing this challenge, BMSD has engaged a team of student consultants from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. These consultants are tasked with analyzing the district's transportation operations, financial data, and stakeholder concerns to develop actionable recommendations. The consulting team has the unique opportunity to interview key stakeholders within BMSD to gather insights and data. Their final deliverable will be a two-page memo addressed to Superintendent Dr. Emily Carter, outlining their strategic recommendations for resolving the transportation crisis. However, the students are not specialized in school transportation and operations research, so they have to rely on the characters' knowledge and help.

## Historical Context

The Boston Metro School District (BMSD) has been a cornerstone of public education in Massachusetts since its establishment in 1647, making it America's first public school district. Throughout its history, BMSD has faced numerous challenges, with transportation and equity being central to many of its most significant moments.

**Early Years (1647 - 1960s):**  
In its earliest days, transportation was largely informal, with students walking or relying on community-organized rides. The introduction of motorized buses in the early 20th century marked the beginning of organized student transportation. By the 1960s, de facto segregation had created stark disparities between schools in different neighborhoods, with many minority students attending overcrowded, underfunded schools while nearby schools in predominantly white neighborhoods had empty seats.

**Desegregation and the Busing Crisis (1970s):**  
In 1974, Federal Judge W. Arthur Garrity ruled that BMSD had deliberately segregated its schools and ordered a comprehensive desegregation plan. The implementation of court-mandated busing sparked intense resistance, particularly in working-class neighborhoods. The first day of school in September 1974 saw widespread protests and violence, with the National Guard being called in to maintain order. Despite fierce opposition and "anti-busing" movements, the district persisted with the desegregation effort. This period fundamentally reshaped the district's approach to student assignment and transportation, establishing busing as not just a means of transportation but a tool for achieving educational equity.

**Post-Desegregation Era (1980s - 2000s):**  
The aftermath of the busing crisis led to significant demographic changes in the district. Many middle-class families moved to the suburbs or enrolled their children in private schools, leading to a decline in overall enrollment. The district responded by implementing various school choice policies and magnet programs to attract and retain students. These initiatives, while successful in some aspects, added complexity to the transportation system as students increasingly traveled across the city to attend schools outside their neighborhoods.

**Modern Challenges (2000s - Present):**  
By the early 2000s, the district faced new pressures: aging bus fleets, rising fuel costs, and stricter environmental standards. The introduction of route optimization technologies and GPS tracking provided some relief, but transportation costs continued to surge. The district's commitment to school choice, special education transportation requirements, and the legacy of desegregation created a complex network of bus routes across the city. By 2025, the transportation budget has become one of the most significant financial burdens on the district, forcing discussions about route consolidation and potential school closures.

## Current Situation (2025)

BMSD's transportation crisis has reached a critical point, threatening the very foundation of the district's operations. The situation has become a frequent topic of discussion in local media, community meetings, and even at the State House, where legislators are watching closely.

### The Crisis at Hand
- The transportation budget has spiraled to unprecedented levels.
- A team of transportation planners, led by the COO, try their best to create and improve bus routes every year, but it is not enough.
- The district is facing a critical financial crisis, which could force cuts to essential educational programs and closing schools.
- Parents are increasingly vocal about long commute times, with some students spending over 90 minutes each way
- Community groups are organizing protests against potential school closures
- The teachers' union has expressed concerns about how transportation issues affect student attendance and performance

### Recent Developments
The district has undertaken several initiatives to address the crisis:

1. **MIT Partnership**: A team of operations researchers from MIT has developed a new routing algorithm in collaboration with Sarah Lee, the COO of BMSD. While the results look promising on paper, implementation remains uncertain.

2. **School Start Time Analysis**: Two years ago, the district explored staggered start times to reduce the number of buses needed during peak hours. This has sparked heated debates at school committee meetings, with parents and teachers divided on the potential impact. No implementation happened yet.

3. **Community Engagement**: The district has held several town halls to discuss potential solutions, including:
   - Route consolidation
   - School closures/mergers
   - Alternative transportation options for certain student groups
So far, each of these initiatives has been met with strong opposition from the community.

4. **Kellogg Consultation**: In a novel approach, the district has engaged MBA students from Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management to provide fresh perspectives on the crisis, with a focus on the spiraling transportation costs. Their upcoming recommendations are eagerly anticipated by all stakeholders.


## Key Stakeholders in BMSD's Transportation Crisis

Here is the list of people that the Kellogg team can interview:

### Dr. Emily Carter - Superintendent

Dr. Emily Carter has been the Superintendent of BMSD for the past five years. Known for her progressive stance on education equity and decisive leadership, she is now facing one of the most challenging periods of her tenure. She is the primary point of contact for the Kellogg team and will be the recipient of their final recommendations.

### Mr. James Thompson - Chief Financial Officer (CFO)

Mr. James Thompson oversees the district's financial operations. With his background in corporate finance, he manages the district's budget and financial planning. He has access to detailed financial data and enrollment information, making him the key contact for understanding the district's financial situation and constraints.


### Ms. Sarah Lee - Chief Operations Officer (COO)

Ms. Sarah Lee manages the district's day-to-day operations and has been instrumental in exploring technological solutions to the transportation crisis. She recently led a collaboration with MIT researchers on a new routing algorithm and is actively involved in both operational planning and union negotiations. She is the go-to person for understanding the complexities of the district's transportation system.

### Mr. David Rodriguez - Principal of Osprey Gardens K-8

Mr. David Rodriguez leads one of the district's most economically disadvantaged schools. He is a vocal advocate for educational equity and has expressed strong concerns about potential cost-cutting measures. His perspective represents the school-level impact of transportation decisions and their effects on student access to education.

### Ms. Linda Johnson - Bus Driver

Ms. Linda Johnson brings over twenty years of experience as a BMSD bus driver. As a respected member of the bus drivers' union, she offers valuable front-line insights into the daily challenges of student transportation. Her practical knowledge of routes, schedules, and on-the-ground realities makes her an important voice in understanding operational inefficiencies.

## School District Information.

The Boston Metro School District (BMSD) is the largest school district in Massachusetts, serving around 50,000 students in the Boston metropolitan area. The district is heavily inspired by Boston Public Schools. Here is a list of all schools, with a mapping to their original name in BPS. NEVER REFER TO BPS, ONLY BMSD. You can use the correspondance with BPS names to add color to your responses (e.g., if you know that Boston Latin School is one of the best public schools in the US, you can use the same story for the Briarwood Latin School BMSD equivalent).

# Specific Knowledge

General school district data:
- The current student enrollment for the school year 2024-2025 is 57,517 students.
- The district has 123 schools.
- School-by-school detailed data is available at [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lh1up3CFTkr_69N50Vp-IlAxnNsQEezy5OxSTHJTO1A/copy).
  - Contains the list of schools, their enrollment, start times, and the fraction of economically disadvantaged students.

School Transportation System:
- Not all students require transportation. Some students live in the same neighborhood as their school / are transported by their parents.
- The district is required to provide transportation to all families/students who ask for it.
- Every year, bus routes are constructed to get kids to school on time. They need to change every year to account for new students, new developments, and changes in enrollment.
- Over the summer, a team of 5 transport planners build the routes "manually", with the help of the visualization software "Versatrans".
- This process takes 6 weeks, and involves:
  - Selecting which bus stops students should walk to
  - Connecting bus stops into bus routes. A bus routes pick up students and send them to a specific school in the morning. In the afternoon, another bus route sends them back home. 
  - Buses cannot have students from different schools mixed together, as it would be too complicated to manage.
  - There is only one type of bus, which can carry at most 72 students (depending on their age)
  - A huge cost saver is to "reuse" buses between schools. For example, say school A starts at 7:30 am, B starts at 8:30 am and C starts at 9:30 am. Then, it may be possible for the same bus/driver to first send children to school A, then start picking up new children from school B and finish another route, and then do the same for school C. 
    - at BMSD, this is typically the most efficient way to save money. At most, buses can be reused 3 times in the morning and 3 times in the afternoon. Reusing a bus X times reduces the costs by a factor of X, as the main costs are the bus-related costs (purchase, maintenance, parking, etc.) and the driver-related costs (wages, benefits, etc.).
- In 2024-2025, this manual process led to these "key" operational numbers:
  - **750 buses/drivers** are required to transport the students. 
  - On average, each driver/bus serves 2.2 routes in the morning and 2.2 routes in the afternoon.
  - On average, **students spend 37 min on the bus** in the morning and 37 min in the afternoon.
    - there is great variability across routes/students. Some students spend more than 1.5 h on the bus in the morning and afternoon.
- Given the recent progress in AI/optimization algorithms, Ms. Lee is exploring the possibility of using AI to optimize the routes. She has been in touch with the MIT operations research team, who have developed a new routing algorithm that they claim shows potential 10-15% reduction in required buses.
  - The algorithm is detailed in [following research paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1811462116), but it is technical and the Kellogg team should only read it if they are interested in the technical details.
  - This algorithm goes through all the steps of the manual process, but automatically.
  - It uses "optimization" to find the best routes, which is a mathematical way to ask a computer to find the best solution given predefined constraints and objectives.
  - The MIT team iterated with Ms. Lee so that the algorithm meets the constraints and objectives of BMSD. For example, by law, bus routes cannot be longer than 1h on average, unless there is no other option. 
  - However, the algorithm has never been tested in the real world.
- The MIT team has just finished building a simulator that can be used to test the new algorithm. 
  - It is available at [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12eTU61W4BJUHuW2ffsKH6znAxKTyaqTV0hyimpYNCOU/copy).
  - It uses a Google Sheet, but connects to a remote server to run the optimization.
  - Ms. Lee has not tested it yet, but she is confident that it is a good simulator.
  - The simulator is based on the 2024-2025 school year. It uses estimated travel times from the past year, but it should be close.
  - To use it, simply open the sheet and go to the \`Simulation\` tab.
  - There is only one parameter to set: the target number of children per bus, which is in cell \`C2\` (highlighted in yellow).
    - this parameter is important, as the optimization algorithms can always "fill the bus more" and run much longer routes. This decreases the number of buses required (as each bus picks up more children), but it increases the average travel time for each child.
    - This parameter can be fractional. For example, setting it to 30.1 means that, _on average_, each bus will pick up 30.1 children. However, the actual number of children picked up will vary, and some buses will be full (72 children) while others will be almost empty. This is because some routes are really difficult: for example, if a child lives far away from the school, in an area without other students of that school close-by, the bus serving her will often be almost empty.
    - Ms. Lee thinks that this parameter is important, but does not know how to set it.
    - If the parameter is set too high, the algorithm may not find a solution: indeed, it may not be feasible to "fill the bus" and still meet the legal constraints of the school districts (for example, there is a limit on the number of hours a bus or a child can be on the road).
  - The simulator will output two numbers in the \`Simulation\` tab:
    - The number of buses required to serve all the routes
    - The average travel time for each child (which is roughly the same in the morning and afternoon)
  - The \`schools\` tab contains more detailed information about the routes. For each school, it provides:
    - The number of buses required to serve the school
    - The average travel time of the school's transported children.
  - If it's helpful, students can also use this tab to modify the start times of the schools. These changes will be taken into account by the simulator.
- One concern is that the simulator could change the routes significantly from the status quo, which may confuse parents and drivers. But Ms. Lee thinks that this is only a passing issue and it should be fine.
- Ms. Lee really wants to switch to the algorithm, but she is facing resistance from the superintendent, who is worried that things might break. She hopes that the Kellogg team can help her convince the superintendent.
- Ms. Lee is convinced that technology will win, and that the algorithm will be a success. 
- If the number of bus drivers is reduced, she thinks she could convince the union by simply freezing hiring new drivers and not replacing them when they leave.
