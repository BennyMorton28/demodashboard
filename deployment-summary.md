# Deployment and Debugging Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Server Configuration Fixed**
   - The server was previously trying to use `next start` with a standalone build
   - Changed to use `node .next/standalone/server.js` via a PM2 ecosystem file
   - Server is now running correctly with the proper configuration

2. **Debugging Tools Deployed**
   - Deployed all the debugging tools we created previously:
     - Enhanced success page with detailed debugging info
     - `/api/check-demo-creation` endpoint
     - `/api/debug-demo` endpoint
     - Log collection system

3. **Project Files Updated**
   - Added proper PM2 ecosystem configuration file
   - Setup PM2 to restart automatically on server reboot

## Zoo-Lander Demo Issue

We've investigated the "Demo Not Available" error for the zoo-lander demo and found:

1. **Missing Files**: None of the required files for the zoo-lander demo exist on the server:
   - No assistant component file
   - No prompt file
   - No content directory
   - No demo info file
   - No page file

2. **Likely Causes**:
   - The demo creation process failed completely
   - The demo was never fully created
   - The files were deleted at some point

3. **Solution**:
   - You'll need to create the zoo-lander demo again from scratch
   - Use the new debugging tools by adding `?debug=true` to the success URL
   - This will help you identify any issues during the creation process

## How to Use Debugging Tools

1. **For New Demos**:
   - After creating a demo, visit: `https://demos.noyesai.com/demos/YOUR-DEMO-ID/create-success?id=YOUR-DEMO-ID&debug=true`
   - This will show detailed information about file creation status

2. **For Troubleshooting**:
   - Use `https://demos.noyesai.com/api/check-demo-creation?id=YOUR-DEMO-ID` to check if files exist
   - Use `https://demos.noyesai.com/api/debug-demo?id=YOUR-DEMO-ID&includeData=true` to get detailed file information

The `debugging-guide.md` file contains more detailed instructions on using these tools.
