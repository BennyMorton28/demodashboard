# BMSD Transportation Case Study

The Burlington-Montague School District (BMSD) is facing significant challenges with its student transportation system. This case study explores the complex issues surrounding the district's transportation crisis and invites you to engage with key stakeholders to develop sustainable solutions.

## Background

BMSD serves a diverse student population across urban and rural areas. The district has recently faced budget constraints that have impacted its ability to maintain adequate transportation services for all students. Rising fuel costs, driver shortages, and aging bus fleets have exacerbated these challenges.

## The Crisis

The district's transportation system is at a breaking point:

- Bus routes have been reduced, leaving some students without reliable transportation
- Remaining routes are overcrowded, with some students facing 90+ minute commutes
- Driver shortages have led to frequent cancellations and delays
- Maintenance issues with aging buses have created safety concerns
- Transportation costs are consuming an increasing share of the district's budget

## Key Stakeholders

This simulation allows you to interact with key district stakeholders, each with their own perspective on the transportation crisis:

- **Dr. Emily Carter (Superintendent)**: Responsible for the overall operation of the district and accountable to the school board, Dr. Carter is seeking balanced solutions that address transportation needs while maintaining educational quality.

- **Ms. Linda Johnson (Bus Driver)**: A veteran bus driver with 15 years of experience, Linda provides firsthand insights into the daily challenges faced by transportation staff.

- **Mr. David Rodriguez (Principal)**: Principal of Burlington East High School, Mr. Rodriguez advocates for solutions that prioritize student attendance and educational access.

- **Ms. Sarah Lee (Chief Operations Officer)**: Oversees district logistics including transportation, Ms. Lee is focused on operational efficiency and budget constraints.

- **Mr. James Thompson (Chief Financial Officer)**: Responsible for district finances, Mr. Thompson emphasizes the fiscal realities limiting transportation options.

## Your Challenge

Engage with these stakeholders to:

1. Understand the complexities of the transportation crisis from multiple perspectives
2. Identify key factors contributing to the current situation
3. Explore potential solutions that balance educational access, safety, fiscal responsibility, and equity
4. Consider the trade-offs and impacts of various approaches
5. Develop recommendations for sustainable transportation solutions
